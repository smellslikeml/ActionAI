ActionAI is a python library for training machine learning models to classify human action. It is a generalization of our [yoga smart personal trainer](https://www.hackster.io/yogai/yogai-smart-personal-trainer-f53744), which is included in this repo as an example.

## Getting Started 
These instructions will show how to prepare your image data, train a model, and deploy the model to classify human action from image samples. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live stream.

### Installation

Add the smellslikeml PPA and install with the following:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:smellslikeml/ppa
sudo apt update

# Install with:
sudo apt-get install actionai
```

Make sure to configure the working directory with:
```
actionai configure
```

### Using the CLI

Organize your training data in subdirectories like the example below. The `actionai` cli will automatically create a dataset from subdirectories of videos where each subdirectory is a category label.

```
.
└── dataset/
    ├── category_1/
    │   └── *.mp4
    ├── category_2/
    │   └── *.mp4
    ├── category_3/
    │   └── *.mp4
    └── ...
```

Then you can train a model with:
```
actionai train --data=/path/to/your/data/dir --model=/path/to/your/model/dir
```

And then run inference on a video with:
```
actionai predict --model=/path/to/your/model/dir --video=/path/to/your/video.mp4
```

View the default `config.ini` file included in this branch for additional configurations. You can pass your own config file using the `--cfg` flag.
